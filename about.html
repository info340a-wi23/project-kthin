                <p>
                    Our mission is to combat fast fashion and show consumers that there are more ethical clothing options for them. 
                    In contrast to fast fashion, sustainable fashion is a term that is used to describe fashion
                    that is both ethically made and environmentally friendly. This means that the clothing garments that are
                    created reduces the impact on the environment and is mindful of the workers who produce these clothing
                    garments. We aim to offer multiple store options at different price points, to accomodate all of our users price preferences.

            <h1>Facts About Consumerism</h1>
            
            <p>
                With an increase in social media usage over the last years, trends come and go faster than ever. Social media
                influencers encourage their viewers to participate in these trends by endorsing brands, granting the brands more 
                popularity while also benefiting the influencer through portions of the profits. This results in mass consumerism;
                people want to keep up with trends but don't want to spend a lot on new pieces of clothing that will ultimately go
                out of style in a couple weeks. Consumerism can be ready about <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/america-in-the-world/us-mass-consumerism-in-transnational-perspective/C87883D798FBA090A8FB47F0C8E473D1" target="_blank">here </a>
                 and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210120-how-the-world-became-consumerist" target="_blank">here.</a>
                There are a number of issues with fast fashion, such as water pollution, waste management,
                greenhouse gas emissions, and more. People can also be unaware that they are actually consumers of fast
                fashion, or they don't know what alternate options there are out there and don't know where to start. Our
                team wants to create a shopping website that promotes and encourages partaking in sustainable fashion.
