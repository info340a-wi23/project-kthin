        <h2>Problem & Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            A common passion and interest all of our team members found that we shared is fashion, specifically fashion
            sustainability. In contrast to fast fashion, sustainable fashion is a term that is used to describe fashion
            that is both ethically made and environmentally friendly. This means that the clothing garments that are
            created reduces the impact on the environment and is mindful of the workers who produce these clothing
            garments. There are a number of issues with fast fashion, such as water pollution, waste management,
            greenhouse gas emissions, and more. People can also be unaware that they are actually consumers of fast
            fashion, or they don't know what alternate options there are out there and don't know where to start. Our
            team wants to create a shopping website that promotes and encourages partaking in sustainable fashion.
        </p>

            In general, most people are unaware of how the fashion industry pollutes the world. They are also unaware of affordable sustainable clothing. One existing 
            solution to this problem would be to look up the most sustainable brands. However, this list is not currated to the person's style or price range. Fast 
            fashion is also accompanied by poor working conditions, results in carbon emissons, and countless other harmful environmental effects.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The primary users of the application will be working age young adults, between the ages of 18-30. We also want to make sure to accomodate those in a lower
                socio-economic bracket by providing brands that are sustainable and affordable.
            </li>
            <li>One feature of our app would be a searching capability to find sustainable brands that sell the desired product. Another capabilty would be to sort through 
                categories of different styled clothes. The user could select a style, such as "nigh out", and the site would reccomend sustainable brand options. The last 
                feature we will add is the ability to sort by price range. 
            </li>
            <li>The users will be viewing lists of sustainable fashion companies.</li>
            <li>This app works to combat the lack of information surrounding fast fashion alternatives. We want to provide young people with the option to buy the clothes
                they desire from companies that are fair to employees and good for the environment. 
            </li>
        </ul>
