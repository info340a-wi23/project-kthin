        <h2>Problem & Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            A common passion and interest all of our team members found that we shared is fashion, specifically fashion
            sustainability. In contrast to fast fashion, sustainable fashion is a term that is used to describe fashion
            that is both ethically made and environmentally friendly. This means that the clothing garments that are
            created reduces the impact on the environment and is mindful of the workers who produce these clothing
            garments. There are a number of issues with fast fashion, such as water pollution, waste management,
            greenhouse gas emissions, and more. People can also be unaware that they are actually consumers of fast
            fashion, or they don't know what alternate options there are out there and don't know where to start. Our
            team wants to create a shopping website that promotes and encourages partaking in sustainable fashion.
